=== How to promote a build:

Create a new tag that names the release.  E.g.

$ svn copy https://api.taglets.org/svn/phreezdry/trunk https://api.taglets.org/svn/phreezdry/tags/release-1.0 -m"tag release 1.0" 

Check out a copy of that tag and do a promoted build on it:

$ sh scripts/promote.sh

which puts the SVN revision and build date into
src/main/resources/build.properties, which can then be queried in
a running server using 

$ scripts/buildInfo.sh

Then deploy to Joyent phreezdry.com:

Monitor the jetty runtime log at /var/logs/jetty.log

- stop jetty using 'sh /var/jetty/stopJetty.sh'
- remove work directory using 'rm -rf /var/jetty/current/work/*'
- copy war file into /var/jetty/current/webapps/
- start jetty using 'sh /var/jetty/startJetty.sh'
- do a test operation using 'sh scripts/createDocument.sh', which should produce

	- 201 Created
	- 200 OK:  original and retrieved documents match
