1) How to promote a build:

$ sh scripts/promote.sh

which puts the SVN revision and build date into
src/main/resources/build.properties, which can then be queried in
a running server using scripts/buildInfo.sh

2) How to deploy onto Joyent phreezdry.com:

Monitor the jetty runtime log at /var/logs/jetty.log

- stop jetty using 'sh /var/jetty/stopJetty.sh'
- remove work directory using 'rm -rf /var/jetty/current/work/*'
- copy war file into /var/jetty/current/webapps/
- start jetty using 'sh /var/jetty/startJetty.sh'
- do a test operation using 'sh scripts/createDocument.sh', which should produce

	- 201 Created
	- 200 OK:  original and retrieved documents match

3) tail the Joyent runtime and request logs remotely

$ sh scripts/tailJettyLog.sh

$ sh scripts/tailRequests.sh
